Welcome to Bananes website. Here I will document all my stuff. 

This site was created at the beginning of 2023 because I was getting too lazy to document my private projects within the own repos and needed a general overview. 

Also it's quite cumbersome to upload the content on the two platforms I mainly use: 
- GroovyMAME / GroovyArcade discord: https://discord.gg/YtQ6pJh
- Forum Arcade Zone: https://forum.arcade-zone.de

Why in english?  I'm not a hipster, blame all the French, Irish, Spanish, Americans, Australians etc you have to deal with in your hobbies these days. 

Have fun or look away. And above all: cheers !

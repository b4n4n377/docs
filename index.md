Welcome to Bananes website. Here I will document all my stuff. 

This site was created at the beginning of 2023 because I was getting too lazy to document my private projects within the own repos and needed a general overview. 

Also it's quite cumbersome to upload the content on the two platforms I mainly use: 
- [GroovyMAME/GroovyArcade discord](https://link-url-here.org](https://discord.gg/YtQ6pJh)
- [Forum Arcade Zone](https://forum.arcade-zone.de)

Why in English and not in German?  I'm not a hipster, blame all the French, Irish, Spanish, Americans, Australians etc you have to deal with in your hobbies these days. 

Have fun or look away. And above all: cheers !

## Home
Here I will document all my stuff.

This site was created at the beginning of 2023 because I was getting too lazy to document my private projects within the own repos and needed a general overview. 

Also it's quite cumbersome to upload content on the two platforms I mainly use: 
- [GroovyMAME / GroovyArcade Discord](https://discord.gg/YtQ6pJh)
- [Forum Arcade Zone](https://forum.arcade-zone.de)

Why in English and not in German?  I'm not a hipster, blame all the French, Irish, English, Swedish, Norwegian, Finns, Spanish, Americans, Australians etc you have to deal with in your hobbies these days. 

Have fun or look away. And above all: cheers !

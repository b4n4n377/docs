# HP 5006 A Signature Analyzer

Today I received an HP 5006 A Signature Analyzer that had been in the post from the UK for several months.  Hey N., as you can see, it has finally arrived. Many thanks and 'Up the Evri' :-D. 

The very first thing I did was to clean the unit thoroughly with Irox plastic cleaner and isopropanol before switching it on for the first time. This was not really necessary, but it is a standard procedure for me when I receive new hardware. 

The service manual one can easily find online, e.g. [here](https://arcarc.xmission.com/Test%20Equipment/HP/HP%205006A.pdf)
